# Automated Tomato Sorting with Python and OpenCV

This project is designed to automate the sorting of tomatoes based on their color (green, yellow, and red) using Python and OpenCV. The system categorizes tomatoes into three groups:

- **Green**: Unripe tomatoes
- **Yellow**: Normal, ripe tomatoes
- **Red**: Fully ripe tomatoes

Additionally, the system calculates and displays the price for each tomato and the total price based on the classification.

## Features

- **Tomato Sorting**: Automatically categorizes tomatoes into three groups (green, yellow, and red) based on color.
- **Price Calculation**: The price of each tomato is calculated based on its classification (green, yellow, or red).
- **Total Price Calculation**: The total price for all tomatoes is calculated and displayed.
- **Real-time Processing**: The system can process tomatoes in real-time via webcam or uploaded image.
